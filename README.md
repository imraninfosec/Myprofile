- 📈 **100% uptime** in production environment
- 👔 **C-suite visibility** - Daily security intelligence for executives
- 🔒 **Data privacy** - All AI processing happens locally
- ⏱️ **Time savings** - 4 hours → 30 minutes daily curation

**Technologies:**
- AI/ML: Ollama, Mistral 7B, Llama 3 (local deployment)
- Frontend: React 18, Chart.js, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Celery, PostgreSQL
- Automation: n8n workflow engine, scheduled jobs
- Infrastructure: Docker Compose, Nginx, Redis

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Local LLM deployment eliminating cloud API costs
- Automated approval workflow for security team review
- Real-time threat metric visualization
- Industry-specific filtering (logistics/supply chain context)
